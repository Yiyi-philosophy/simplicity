# RLlib

- Challenge

	- Because of the absence of a single dominant computational pattern  or fundamental rules of composition, the design and implementation of RL algorithms is hard for researchers.

- Insight

	- **Irregularity** of RL training workloads Modern RL algorithms are highly irregular in the computation patterns they create

		1. The duration and **resource requirements** of tasks differ by orders of magnitude depending on the algorithm
		2. **Communication** patterns vary
		3. **Nested** **computations** are generated by model-based hybrid algorithms

		4. Maintain and update substantial **amounts** of **state**

- Contribution

	- Distributing RL components in a composable way by adapting algorithms for top-down hierarchical control, thereby encapsulating **parallelism** and resource requirements within short-running compute tasks.
	- These primitives enable a broad range of algorithms to be implemented with **high performance**, scalability, and **substantial code reuse**.
