> [https://www.sigops.org/awards/hof/](https://www.sigops.org/awards/hof/)

The selection committee for these awards is made up of the program chairs/co-chairs of the SOSP/OSDI conferences which were held within that 10-11 year timeframe. In case of conflict of interests, program chairs from earlier SOSP/OSDI conferences help make the selection.

The decision will be based on a discussion that considers the impact the paper (and more generally of the research described in the paper) has had on the field of operating systems research. The Award committee will prepare a short statement that describes why the paper was selected. For an in-depth discussion of the SIGOPS policy for this award, please read Jeff Mogul‚Äôs Policies for the SIGOPS Hall of Fame Award.

The award winners will be announced at the SOSP or OSDI conference by the current program chair. The program chair will read the statement prepared by the Award committee that describes why the paper was selected. The authors of the award-winning paper will be given a plaque, naming the paper, the authors, the conference or journal the paper appeared in, and the conference in which the award was made. This certificate will be signed by the program chair and the current chair of SIGOPS. A list of the winners of the award will be maintained on the SIGOPS website.

 James C. Corbett, Jeffrey Dean, Michael Epstein, Andrew Fikes, Christopher Frost, JJ Furman, Sanjay Ghemawat, Andrey Gubarev, Christopher Heiser, Peter Hochschild, Wilson Hsieh, Sebastian Kanthak, Eugene Kogan, Hongyi Li, Alexander Lloyd, Sergey Melnik, David Mwaura, David Nagle, Sean Quinlan, Rajesh Rao, Lindsay Rolig, Yasushi Saito, Michal Szymaniak, Christopher Taylor, Ruth Wang, and Dale Woodford, Google, Inc. For their paper Spanner: Google‚Äôs Globally-Distributed Database. In OSDI‚Äô12: Proceedings of the 10th USENIX conference on Operating systems design and implementation. ‚ÄúSpanner showed how to balance the requirements of consistency, availability, and partition tolerance for a globally replicated transactional database system. In doing so, Spanner simplified the implementation of a range of higher level services which could then scale across the planet through a familiar and powerful transactional API. The key insights of leveraging clock synchronization using TrueTime and a dedicated, redundant, high-capacity datacenter WAN distinct from the public Internet as the basis for scaling remain fundamental design patterns today.‚Äù

- üî≤ Yuan Yu, Michael Isard, Dennis Fetterly, Mihai Budiu, √ölfar Erlingsson, Pradeep Kumar Gunda, and Jon Currey. DryadLINQ: A System for General-Purpose Distributed Data-Parallel Computing Using a High-Level Language. In OSDI‚Äô08: Proceedings of the 8th USENIX Conference on Operating Systems Design and Implementation, 2008. DryadLINQ demonstrated how to provide declarative operations on top of a distributed dataflow system, making it convenient for programmers to compute on large data sets using relational operators while providing high-performance.  Its techniques include translating data-parallel operations into a distributed execution plan for the Dryad data flow system.

In OSDI‚Äô08: Proceedings of the 8th USENIX Conference on Operating Systems Design and Implementation, 2008. KLEE shows how to scale symbolic execution to generating automatic tests that achieve high coverage and applying it to widely-used software, including the GNU COREUTILS utility programs.  The authors demonstrated KLEE‚Äôs effectiveness on heavily-used programs by finding bugs that manual testing has missed. The ideas and results have been an inspiration for many subsequent work on automatic bug finding.

# 2017

- üî≤ Mike Burrows. The Chubby lock service for loosely-coupled distributed systems. In Proceedings of the 7th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI 2006), 335-350. The Chubby lock service provides coarse-grained locking and reliable, low-volume storage for a loosely-coupled distributed system, and is particularly useful for synchronizing activities between clients. Chubby uses Paxos internally, but exposes a lock-service API to its clients, intended to simplify its adoption by programmers. The paper was one of the first to discuss the challenges of engineering a high-availability service for use by a wide range of programmers in a globally-distributed environment. While Chubby itself is widely used only within Google, the paper inspired open-source implementations of similar services, such as Zookeeper, that provide similar functionality.
- üî≤ Giuseppe DeCandia, Deniz Hastorun, Madan Jampani, Gunavardhan Kakulapati, Avinash Lakshman, Alex Pilchin, Swaminathan Sivasubramanian, Peter Vosshall, and Werner Vogels. Dynamo: Amazon‚Äôs Highly Available Key-value Store. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM  Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP 2007), 205-220. Dynamo is a scalable and highly reliable distributed key-value store. The paper describes how Dynamo manages the tradeoffs between availability, consistency, cost-effectiveness, and performance, and explains how the system combines a variety of techniques: consistent hashing, vector clocks, sloppy quorums, Merkle trees, and gossip-based membership and failure detection protocols. In particular, the paper emphasizes the value of supporting eventual consistency in order to provide high availability in a distributed system. Dynamo evolved within Amazon to become the basis of a popular cloud service, and also inspired open-source systems such as Cassandra.

# 2015

- üî≤ R. A. Meyer and L. H. Seawright. A virtual machine time-sharing system. IBM Systems Journal 9(3), September 1970, 199-218. This paper described the second generation of the very first virtual machine system. It was originally built in 1966 for an IBM 360/40 with custom virtual memory hardware and then ported to a 360/67, which had virtual memory built in. In addition to a virtual machine monitor called CP, the system included a single user interactive system called CMS, heavily influenced by MIT‚Äôs CTSS; to support multiple users the system ran CMS in a separate VM for each user. Because of the clean architecture of the 360, CP could virtualize the hardware perfectly (except for timing dependencies and self-modifying channel programs) without binary translation, though it did have to translate the channel programs. It could run most of the existing IBM operating systems in virtual machines. CP/67 evolved into VM/370, which became the main time-sharing system for IBM mainframes.
- üî≤ David. L. Parnas. On the criteria to be used in decomposing systems into modules. Communications of the ACM 15(12), December 1972, 1053-1058. This paper introduced a technique for decomposing a complex system into modules. Through a simple example it showed that a modularization that emphasizes what is now known as ‚Äúinformation hiding‚Äù is superior to more obvious module decompositions in terms of the software engineering lifecycle. The paper argues the beneficial decomposition can be achieved with minimal performance overheads. The ‚Äúinformation hiding‚Äù approach has influenced software engineering in areas including operating systems, distributed systems, databases, and programming languages.
- üî≤ H. T. Kung and John T. Robinson. On optimistic methods for concurrency control. ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS) 6(2), June 1981, 213-226. This paper introduced the notion of optimistic concurrency control, proceeding with a transaction without locking the data items accessed, in the expectation that the transaction‚Äôs accesses will not conflict with those of other transactions. This idea, originally introduced in the context of conventional databases, has proven very powerful when transactions are applied to general-purpose systems.
- üî≤ Marshall K. McKusick, William N. Joy, Samuel J. Leffler, and Robert S. Fabry A fast file system for UNIX. ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS) 2(3), August 1984, 181-197. This paper introduced techniques to make the file system ‚Äúdisk aware‚Äù, thus demonstrating the importance of understanding the interplay between hardware technology and file-system design. The structuring concept of the cylinder group, while simple, is found in some form in many current systems (including the widely-deployed Linux ext* family) and serves as an excellent example of the importance of locality in storage. The paper also introduced numerous functionality improvements, including symbolic links and atomic rename, which have since become commonplace features in modern file systems.
- üî≤ James J. Kistler and M. Satyanarayanan. Disconnected operation in the Coda File System. ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS) 10(1), February 1992, 3-25. This paper was the first to describe the use of caching to provide availability in addition to improved performance in a distributed setting where clients use files stored at remote file servers, leading to potential loss of service during disconnection. The Coda design provided a thoughtful and elegant approach to supporting continued service during disconnection. Disconnected clients continued to service user requests using locally cached content; however all potential modifications performed while disconnected were logged locally, and when service was restored the system attempted to reconcile the local modifications with the current server state. The Coda design inspired much follow-on research on distributed file systems and its techniques were adopted in other systems.
- üî≤ Maurice Herlihy and J. Eliot B. Moss. Transactional memory: architectural support for lock-free data structures. In Proceedings of the 20th annual international symposium on computer architecture (ISCA ‚Äô93), May 1993, 289-300. This paper introduced transactional memory, an architectural concept intended to make lock-free synchronization as efficient and easy to use as conventional techniques based on mutual exclusion. This concept has found its way into commercial multicore processors, and has generated a large amount of follow-on work in software transactional memory.
- üî≤ Robert Wahbe, Steven Lucco, Thomas E. Anderson, and Susan L. Graham. Efficient software-based fault isolation. In Proceedings of the 14th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP ‚Äô93). December 1993, 203-216. This paper demonstrated that compiler or code-rewriting techniques could isolate untrusted code modules, preventing them from writing or jumping to addresses outside their ‚Äúfault domain‚Äù, without the overhead of crossing hardware-enforced address space boundaries, and without much increase in execution time of code within a domain. The paper inspired substantial subsequent research, and the basic techniques have been implemented in widely-deployed software, such as Web browsers.
- üî≤ D. B. Terry, M. M. Theimer, Karin Petersen, A. J. Demers, M. J. Spreitzer, and C. H. Hauser. Managing update conflicts in Bayou, a weakly connected replicated storage system. In Proceedings of the 15th ACM symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP ‚Äô95), December 1995, 172-182. Bayou is a replicated storage system that anticipated the world of numerous small mobile devices executing collaborative applications over unreliable networks. The paper describes a client-server storage structure supporting eventual consistency, anti-entropy protocols, disconnected operation, log-based recovery, and an application-centered approach to detecting and resolving update conflicts to arrive at consistent replicas. These concepts were backed up by a prototype implementation, two applications, and a simple performance evaluation. Bayou is still relevant to the problems faced by, and the solutions employed by, a large number of today‚Äôs modern applications.
- üî≤ J. Liedtke. On micro-kernel construction. In Proceedings of the 15th ACM symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP ‚Äô95), December 1995, 237-250. This paper presented the core design ideas behind the L4 microkernel, especially the minimality principle, which states that functionality must only be implemented inside the kernel if moving it outside would prevent the implementation of required system functionality. This principle was at the heart of L4‚Äôs design, and supported a ruthless performance focus, which allowed L4 to outperform other microkernels by an order of magnitude. The core ideas of this paper led to a family of L4 microkernels which were commercially deployed on a large scale, and eventually enabled unprecedented assurance through formal verification.
- üî≤ Ion Stoica, Robert Morris, David Karger, M. Frans Kaashoek, and Hari Balakrishnan. Chord: A scalable peer-to-peer lookup service for Internet applications. In Proceedings of the 2001 conference on Applications, technologies, architectures, and protocols for computer communications (SIGCOMM ‚Äô01), 2001, 149-160. This paper introduced a novel protocol that enables efficient key lookup in a large-scale and dynamic environment; the paper shows how to utilize consistent hashing to achieve provable correctness and performance properties while maintaining a simplicity and elegance of design. The core ideas within this paper have had a tremendous impact both upon subsequent academic work as well as upon industry, where numerous popular key-value storage systems employ similar techniques. The ability to scale while gracefully handling node addition and deletion remains an essential property required by many systems today.
- üî≤ Carl A. Waldspurger. Memory resource management in VMware ESX server. In Proceedings of the 5th Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI ‚Äô02), December 2002, 181-194. This paper introduced elegant and effective techniques of hypervisor memory management. Memory ballooning allows the hypervisor to reclaim memory from a virtual machine in accordance with the unmodified guest‚Äôs operating system policies. Transparent page sharing supports efficient memory use with small overhead. The combination of active memory estimation, idle memory tax, and proportional fair sharing, along with admission-controlled memory reservation,provides the basis for service level agreements and reasoned overcommitment. This paper has been highly influential; many of its techniques have been adopted by widely-used hypervisors.
- üî≤ George W. Dunlap, Samuel T. King, Sukru Cinar, Murtaza A. Basrai, and Peter M. Chen. ReVirt: Enabling intrusion analysis through virtual-machine logging and replay. In Proceedings of the 5th Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI ‚Äô02), 2002, 211-224. The paper demonstrated that the execution of an arbitrary program inside a virtual machine can be replayed deterministically and efficiently. Originally intended primarily as a tool for intrusion analysis, record-and-replay has been used subsequently for debugging, fault-tolerance, to audit program executions, and other virtual machine services. The work has directly influenced commercial products and sparked a research area that continues to this day.
- üî≤ Sanjay Ghemawat, Howard Gobioff, and Shun-Tak Leung. The Google file system. In Proceedings of the 19th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP ‚Äô03). 2003, 29-43. This paper presented an effective design for a large-scale distributed file system that provided fault tolerance while running on inexpensive commodity hardware. It provided very large amounts of I/O bandwidth by having all data transfers happen directly between client processes and machines storing the actual data, handled automatic recovery from failed disks and machines, and retained the simplicity of managing file system metadata in a single centralized master. GFS formed the basis for the design for the open-source HDFS system, as well the backbone for the evolution of large-scale distributed file systems at Google and elsewhere.
- üî≤ Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat. MapReduce: simplified data processing on large clusters. In Proceedings of the 6th Conference on Symposium on Opearting Systems Design & Implementation (OSDI‚Äô04), 2004, USENIX Association. The paper proposed a simple yet highly effective approach for processing large data sets in a scalable and fault-tolerant manner. An impressive aspect of the design is its simplicity: it elegantly captures a common pattern that solves two critical problems faced by many developers today (scalability and fault tolerance), while still retaining a clean, easy-to-use interface that supports a wide range of applications. The impact of MapReduce has been huge. It is widely used in industry, with virtually every large company running MapReduce. As a sign of great system design, developers have adopted MapReduce in many use cases beyond its original goals and inspired many follow-on systems.

The fundamental techniques in the paper are the secret sauce in many distributed algorithms for deadlock detection, termination detection, consistent checkpointing for fault tolerance, global predicate detection for debugging and monitoring, and distributed simulation.
- üî≤ Kenneth P. Birman and Thomas A. Joseph. Exploiting Virtual Synchrony in Distributed Systems in Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP ‚Äô87), Austin, Texas, November 1987.This paper describes a methodology for building distributed applications comprised of multiple components, each realized by a group of replicated servers. It defines a number of group communication primitives and then ties fault notification into the fabric of group services by introducing the virtual synchrony principle, which orders communication and fault notifications consistently among group members and across multiple groups.

- üî≤ George C. Necula and Peter Lee, Safe Kernel Extensions Without Run-Time Checking, Proceedings of the Second USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation, October 1996, Seattle, WA.This paper introduced the notion of proof carrying code (PCC) and showed how it could be used for ensuring safe execution by kernel extensions without incurring run-time overhead. PCC turns out to be a general approach for relocating trust in a system; trust is gained in a component by trusting a proof checker (and using it to check a proof the component behaves as expected) rather than trusting the component per se.

- ‚úÖ Edsger W. Dijkstra, [**The Structure of the THE Multiprogramming System**](https://yiyi-philosophy.github.io/simplicity/SIGOPS-2005-1/), Proceedings of the First ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, October 1967, Gatlinburg, TN, USA.

  - The first paper to suggest that an operating system be built in a **structured** way. That structure was a series of layers, each a virtual machine that introduced abstractions built using the functionality of lower layer. The paper stimulated a great deal of subsequent work in building operating systems as structured systems.
- üî≤ Peter J. Denning, **The Working Set Model for Program Behavior**, Proceedings of the First ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, October 1967, Gatlinburg, TN, USA.

  - This paper introduced the working set model, which has became a key concept in understanding of locality of memory references and for implementing virtual memory. Most paging algorithms can trace their roots back to this work.
- üî≤ Dennis M. Ritchie and Ken Thompson, **The UNIX Time-Sharing System**, Proceedings of the Fourth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, October 1973, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA.

  - At a time when operating systems were trending towards complexity, UNIX emerged as a hallmark of elegance and simplicity.
- üî≤ Butler Lampson, **Hints for Computer System Design**, Proceedings of the Ninth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, pp. 33-48, October 1983, Bretton Woods, NH, USA.

  - A classic study of experience building large systems, distilled into a cookbook of wisdom for the operating systems researcher. As time has passed, the value of these hints has only grown and the range of systems to which they apply enlarged.
