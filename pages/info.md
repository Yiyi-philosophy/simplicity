Here is me!

I experienced a lot of frustration after being an adult, and I was not overwhelmed.

When I am 18, I failed on National College Entrance Examination. And admitted in a second class college and major in math. After first semester studying, I found myself was more interested in CS, so I decided to transfer to CS. However, that transfer was unsuccessful and I was accepted by EE. Although I am sad about this, I am still learning diligently, and in second year I was admitted to the elite class of EE, so I have opportunities to learn more about CS. At the same time, inspired by cmu15-213, I decided to do some system work.

Besides, in my spare time, I like to playing [GO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game))(board game). I really learn a lot from the GO game, for example, the balance between territorial and influence-oriented approach. Since the advent of Alpha-Go, new understanding of this problem was proposed. Besides, sometimes jogging and play badminton are also a great way to free up my stress.
